    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the most well known and ubiquitous way of specifying and installing dependencies in Python is with a requirements.txt file. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "matplotlib\n",
    "numpy\n",
    "requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` for installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To automatically generate a requirements.txt file like this, containing the versions of all the libraries installed in your current Python environment, and all sub-dependencies, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pip freeze```\n",
    "\n",
    "```if __name__ == \"__main__\"``` for when you have a file that can be used both as a script and as a module in a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def greet(personal, family):\n",
    "    return \"Hey, \" + personal + \" \" + family\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(greet(\"Laura\", \"Greeter\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we import this file, we won't print anything. But if we remove the if name main and import the file, we would print the Laura Greeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Turning your code into a package\n",
    "\n",
    "* Source code directory and subdirectories should contain an ```__init__.py```file, which can be empty. Its contents are executedf when we import a package, so we could use them to shortcut imports for convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a readme file\n",
    "* Write a license file\n",
    "* Write a citation file\n",
    "* Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "```def greet(personal, family, title=\"\", polite=False):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Generate a greeting string for a person.\n",

    "    Parameters\n",
    "    ----------\n",
    "    personal: str\n",
    "        A given name, such as Will or Jean-Luc\n",
    "    family: str\n",
    "        A family name, such as Riker or Picard\n",
    "    title: str\n",

    "    polite: bool\n",

    "\n",
    "    greeting = \"How do you do, \" if polite else \"Hey, \"\n",
    "    greeting = Fore.GREEN + greeting\n",
    "    if title:\n",
    "        greeting += Fore.BLUE + title + \" \"\n",
    "\n",
    "    greeting += Fore.RED + personal + \" \" + family + \".\"\n",
    "    return greeting\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bad documentation is detrimental\n",
    "* Good documentation is hard, expensive, bad if not up to date with changes\n",
    "* Without capacity to maintain great documentation, focus on readable code, automated tests, small code samples demonstrating how to use the API.\n",

    "```Sphinx```[website](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is nice for Python.\n",

    "Waterfall:  elements of design should occur in order: first requirements capture, then functional design, then architectural design. If a mistake is made in the design, then programming effort is wasted, so significant effort is spent in trying to ensure that requirements are well understood and that the design is correct before programming starts.\n",
    "Waterfall results in a paperwork culture, where people spend a long time designing standard forms to document each stage of the design, with less time actually spent making things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agile Manifesto: ongoing design, citerative development, continuous delivery (get as quickly as possible to code that can be demonstrated to clients, release early and release often). Most bugs are found by people using code, so exposing code asap will find bugs quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing an open-source license\n",
    "Check Github guide for that.\n",
