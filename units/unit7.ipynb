    "# Construction and design\n",
    "\n",
    "https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rse-course/html/module07_construction_and_design/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Software construction:\n",
    "* Choice of variable names\n",
    "* Choice of comments\n",
    "* Choice of layout\n",
    "* Division of code into subroutines\n",
    "* Choice of algorithms, data structure\n",
    "* Design of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "* Writing code for people as well as computers\n",
    "* Explain subtleties in the code not obvious from the syntax\n",
    "* Explain why you wrote the code the way you did\n",
    "* Mostly for yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layout choices\n",
    "* Brace style\n",
    "* Line length\n",
    "* Indentation\n",
    "Consistency is the most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming conventions\n",
    "Camel case: class name is UpperCamel, function lowerCamel and underscore_separation for variable names. Python has functions as underscore_separation as well, Python coding convention is PEP8.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linters\n",
    "\n",
    "Linters are automated tools that enforce coding conventions and check for common mistakes. Example: black. black is not compliant with PEP8 in one way: the default maximum line length of 88 characters instead of 79 suggested by PEP8.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "* Replace magic numbers with constants: BAD if raw numbers appear in your code\n",
    "* Replace repeated code with a function: BAD if fragments of repeated code appear\n",
    "* Change of variable name: BAD if need comment to explain what it is for\n",
    "* Separate a complex expression into a local variable: BAD if expression is long\n",
    "* Replace loop with iterator: BAD if loop variable is an integer from 1 to something. ```for i in range(res), total += data[i] becomes for value in data, total += value.```\n",
    "* Replace hand-written code with library code: BAD if someone else surely must have done this at some point.\n",
    "* Replace set of arrays with array of structure\n",
    "* Replace constants with a configuration file: BAD if you need to change your code file to explore different research scenario.\n",
    "* Replace global variables with function arguments: BAD if a global variable is assigned and then used inside a called function.\n",
    "* Merge neighbouring loops: BAD if two neighboring loops have the same for statement\n",
    "* Break a large function into smaller units: BAD if a function does not fit in a page of editor, if a line of code is indented by more than three levels, if a piece of code ineracts with surrounding code through just a few variables.\n",
    "* Separate code concepts into files or modules: BAD if you find it hard to locate a piece of code or if you get a lot of version control conflicts.\n",
    "Read [The Refactoring Book](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Orientation\n",
    "Declare a class, create object instances, methods, constructors, member variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object refactoring:\n",
    "* Replace add-hoc structure with user defined classes: BAD if a data structure made of nested arrays and dictionaries becomes unwieldy (heavy).\n",
    "* Replace function with a method: BAD if a function is always called with the same kind of thing\n",
    "* Replace method arguments with class members: BAD if a variable is nearly always used in arguments to a class. Just make it a class object attribute.\n",
    "* Replace global variable with class and member: BAD if a global variable is referenced by a few functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class design\n",
    "In python, we use leading underscores to control whether member variables and methods can be accessed from outside the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* single leading underscore (_) is used to document it’s private but people could use it if wanted (thought they shouldn’t);\n",
    "\n",
    "* double leading underscore (__) raises errors if called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance \n",
    "* Inheritance allows related classes to share code: a bird is a kind of animal, only birds can fly but all animals breath.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, age):\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, age, name):\n",
    "        super().__init__(age)\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Refactoring to inheritance: BAD if repeated code between two classes that are both ontologically subtypes of something\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism \n",
    "\n",
    "If two classes support the same method, but it does different things for the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def noise(self):\n",
    "        return \"I don't make a noise.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def noise(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bark\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Worm(Animal):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Poodle(Dog):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "animals = [Dog(), Worm(), Pig(), Cow(), Poodle()]\n",
    "for animal in animals:\n",
    "    print(animal.noise())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Refactoring to polymorphism: BAD if a function uses a big set of if statements or a case statement to decide what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Patterns\n"
